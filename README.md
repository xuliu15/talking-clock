### Back to Nature Clock with customized Star Wars Alarm ### 
## 7.1
Installation
# STEPS TO RUN AND INSTALL HAVE BEEN TESTED USING MAC OS. THERE MAY BE ISSUES OCCURRING FOR LINUX AND WINDOWS SO BE ADVISED! #

Click on the green Code button at the top of the repository > Download ZIP.
Extract the ZIP to the location where you want to install it on your computer.
(You can also just clone the repository locally if you are familiar with Git. In that case, the steps above can be skipped)

Open the terminal (or command prompt, depending on the OS you use) and navigate to where you extracted the zip via the terminal.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies required.

Requirements before installing
Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed. Download the latest 3.9 version from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
How to Run
Run python main.py in the terminal. Make sure to be in the same directory where the repository is installed in the terminal. It will open an interactive Graphical User Interface.
Within the terminal, move to the root directory, where the requirements file is located. With the command pip install -r requirements.txt you can install all necessary packages to run the code. In case you get a tkinter ImportError, please refer to: https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html. Next, run the file code.py from the root directory with the command python code.py.

One window will open when the command is executed. The window contains the analog clock (with digital clock right below) on the background picture on the right, and control panels on the left.

To start, choose a voice sex and language first (this friendly reminder displayed in light orange on the control panels as well), then you can play around whether you would like the clock to announce the current time by clicking “Announce Current Time”, or let the clock remind you time elapsing hour by hour by pressing the button of “Activate Hourly Time Announcement”. On the top left, you are able to choose the timezone in Amsterdam or Chongqing, once you click one of them, you will notice the analog clock and digital clock change accordingly. This clock across two time zones is beneficial when you would like to schedule a business meeting or call with the family across time zones. You can do so by setting up an alarm by clicking “Set Alarm”, you would have to manually type in year-month-day,however, the drop-down menu for hours and minutes is available. Once the current time hits the scheduled alarm timing, you shall hear the theme songs of Star Wars. Just like how you set alarms on your phones, multiple entries of the alarms are allowed. 
7.2 Team Organization and Project Workflow 
This is the speaking/talking clock that we developed in Python 3.9 for an assignment for the course "Introduction to Voice Technology" as part of the Voice Technology MSc at RUG - Campus Fryslan. 

The team memebrs are Xinyi Ma, Wansu Zhu, Xueying Liu, Cathy Ting Zhang and Sherry Yu-Ting Yeh. 
Our initial brainstorms aim to construct the clock with the following features: time zones, set alarm, change gender, change voice (this specifically refers to voice quality, such that we originally intend to incorporate the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) and change languages.
 
Xinyi Ma: Current Time function. Voice recordings. Video presentation. 
Wansu Zhu: Alarm function. Video presentation.
Xueying Liu: Time announcement function (both synthetic voice and human voice recordings) . Video presentation. 
Cathy Ting Zhang: Time zone function. Time announcement function. Voice recordings. Video presentation. 
Sherry Yu-Ting Yeh: Analog clock, digital clock and the background picture. Documentation.

7.3 The resource documentation and technical reflection

The repository contains the folder "Audios" that includes the .mp3 files the programme uses. 

The synthesized voices ( male Mandarin and English (female and male) voices) were scraped from the link and the actual human voice ( female Mandarin voice ) was recorded by our team member Cathy Ting Zhang. 

The background.png file in the repository is used as the background picture for the clock window.


As for the background picture, we initially aim to construct an interface that can automatically change the background picture once the clock hits 6pm and then change the background picture back again at 6am. However, several attempts have resulted in missing background pictures (i.e. the interface ended up displaying the clock without background pictures) or the numbers on the clock disappeared. Therefore we decided to keep only one background picture. The background picture for night time has been eliminated. Furthermore, the background picture results in a variety of displays on different laptops, the background picture is either missing or becomes a “zoom-in” version that displays only the top left corner which is the sky. 

The alarm function runs successfully in Amsterdam timezone but not Chongqing timezone. 




7.4 GUI user manual

This is a program with an interactive interface that enables users to choose a time zone in either Amsterdam (Europe) or Chongqing (Asia), announce the current time with either actual human voice or synthetic voice, with the option of both female and male voicing.Kindly note that only female Mandarin voice is recorded by actual human, male Mandarin and English (female and male) voices are all generated by synthetic voices.  

Back to Nature Clock provides intuitive operation for users. There is a digital clock display in  24 hours format down below the analog clock, allowing users to figure out day time or night. The hourly time announcement function is also available, along with the customization in voice by gender (female/male) and languages (English/ Mandarin). 

Linguistic Rules for Time Announcement 
While English typically announces time in an AM/PM manner, Mandarin tends to split 24 hours into more time blocks–as in morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and midnight,etc.  The time announcement works in a way that time blocks preceding the exact time (hours and minutes). The other difference is that, for example, as for 12:30, in English can be displayed as twelve thirty or half past twelve, in both progressive and regressive (announcing minutes first, followed by hours) manner, Mandarin can only display in a progressive manner.  On a side note, in Mandarin there are two different characters (which also have different pronunciation) representing the number “2”. In this case, user may notice 12 and 2 sounds phonetically different as 12  is shí èr, while 2 is liǎng. Variety of characters or pronunciation for the same number is not uncommon—Japanese also serves as an example when it comes to pronouncing numbers in different contexts. Furthermore, the concept of o'clock in English is pretty much equivalent to diǎn in Mandarin. However, while in English 12:30 can be announced as twelve thirty without uttering “o'clock”, every time announcement in Mandarin will require the utterance of “diǎn” between hours and minutes. Simply put, spelling out twelve thirty in Mandarin is not allowed, it will be  "shí èr (twelve) diǎn sānshí(thirty)". In Mandarin, the corresponding concept of “half” will be "bàn", so it is also valid to say  "shí èr (twelve) diǎn bàn(thirty, half of 60 mins). 


7.5 Licensing statement / reflection FAIR data / GDPR Compliance
The audio files used were generated using TTS APIs. 

The consent form for the collection of this data is attached since the only actual human voice was recorded by our team member Ting Zhang. 
The data used for the speaking clock therefore complies with GDPR regulations.
